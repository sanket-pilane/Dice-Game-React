# React Dice Game

This is my third React project, a simple dice game that I developed as part of my journey to learn React. In this game, users can select a number between 1 to 6 and then roll the dice by clicking on it. If the rolled number matches the user's selected number, they earn 2 points; otherwise, they lose 2 points. Users can also reset their points at any time.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in several key aspects of React development:

- **Creating a Dynamic Webpage in React:** I learned how to create a dynamic and interactive webpage using React's component-based architecture.

- **Styled Components for Design:** I used styled components to style and design the user interface, making the game visually appealing.

- **State Management:** I acquired knowledge on how to manage the state of the webpage using React's `useState` hook. This allowed me to keep track of user points and the dice roll.

- **Dynamic Image Rendering:** I learned how to dynamically change images based on the dice roll result, providing a visual representation of the game outcome.

- **Passing State via Props:** I gained experience in efficiently passing state between components using props. This allowed different parts of the application to communicate and update based on user actions.

- **JavaScript Logic in React Components:** I developed JavaScript logic to handle game rules and logic within React components. This helped in creating a responsive and interactive user experience.

- **Creating Custom Components with Styled-Components:** I created custom components using styled-components, which enhanced the modularity and maintainability of the codebase while keeping the design consistent.

## Technologies Used

- **React + Vite:** I used React as the core framework for building this application, and Vite as the build tool to enhance the development experience.

- **Styled-Components:** For styling and designing the user interface, I utilized styled-components, allowing me to create a visually appealing and maintainable design.

- **Figma Design:** I began the project by designing the entire game in Figma, enabling me to visualize and plan the user interface and interactions before starting development.



## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sanket-pilane/Dice-Game-React.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm i

3. Run server:
   ```shell
   npm run dev


4. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## How to Play

1. Enter your desired number between 1 and 6 in the input field.

2. Click on the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.

3. If the rolled number matches your selected number, you earn 2 points. If not, you lose 2 points.

4. You can reset your points at any time by clicking the "Reset Points" button.

Enjoy the game and have fun learning React! Feel free to explore the code and make improvements as you continue to develop your React skills.

## Conclusion

Developing this React Dice Game has been an exciting and educational experience. It allowed me to put my React knowledge into practice and learn new skills along the way. By starting with a design in Figma, I was able to plan and create a visually appealing game. Using React, styled-components, and Vite, I built a dynamic and interactive application that incorporates state management and custom components.

This project has not only improved my understanding of React but also enhanced my skills in JavaScript, component-based development, and UI design. As I continue my journey in web development, I look forward to applying the knowledge and techniques I've gained from this project to create even more engaging and innovative web applications.


Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
